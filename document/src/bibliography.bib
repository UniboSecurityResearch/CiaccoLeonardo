abstractNote={
The PlayStation Network outage (sometimes referred to as the PSN Hack) was the result of an "external intrusion" on Sony’s PlayStation Network and Qriocity services, in which personal details from approximately 77 million accounts were compromised and prevented users of PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles from accessing the service. This report dives into the many facets of the PSN hack, exploring the circumstances that led to the breach, the ramifications, and the responses. This case study highlights the need to incorporate these knowledge domains into complete risk mitigation and recovery strategies, reinforcing the importance of proactively handling and aligning stakeholders’ interests. The focus of the report will be on how each of these knowledge domains contributed to considering, dealing with, and eventually recovering from the PlayStation Network attack. In the context of a global-scale data breach, this research serves as a sharp reminder of the consequences of poor procurement management, insufficient risk assessment, quality control, and stakeholder involvement. The insights gathered from this case study will provide significant lessons for organizations across industries, underscoring the crucial relevance of rigorous management practices in protecting the interests of all stakeholders against unanticipated dangers.

abstract="In 2016, Yahoo disclosed to the public that it had been breached in 2014. Yahoo's 2014 breach exposed the names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdates, ``hashed'' passwords, and, in some cases, security questions of over 500 million users. While investigating the breach of 2014, Yahoo discovered that the company had been separately breached in 2013. Yahoo initially reported that the 2013 breach affected over one billion users while it was in the process of getting acquired by Verizon. In October 2017, after its acquisition by Verizon was complete, Yahoo reported that the 2013 breach affected all three billion users. Figure 7-1 shows a timeline of these breaches and the major events that occurred after the breaches. Yahoo was questioned and criticized for disclosing the breaches two to three years after they occurred. During a Senate hearing that took place in the aftermath of the breaches, frustrated Senator Thune of South Dakota asked former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, ``Why the delay in disclosing it? I mean it took from 2013, three years.''",
